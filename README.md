# AlgorithmicToolbox
Exercises for an online course offered on Coursera by University of California, San Diego &amp; National Research University Higher School of Economics

Exercises included "algorithmic warmups", greedy algorithms, and divide-and-conquer. The course offered dynamic programming exercises as well, but I stopped the course before reaching those to focus on school.
